**Last Updated**: October 24, 2025
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Week 1 (Smart Contracts)
**Status**: In Progress

---

## Session History

### Session 1: October 24, 2025 - Project Initialization & Smart Contracts

**Duration**: Complete
**Completed By**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Git Hash**: (if committed)

#### Design Decisions Finalized ✅

All 7 critical design questions have been answered and locked in:

1. **Phase Scope**: Design both layers, build identity first (Phase 1: 4 weeks)
2. **Linked ID System**: Flexible string labels (future-proof, no enum)
3. **Multi-Account**: Allow multiple accounts per platform with justification
4. **Product Ownership** (Phase 2): Mutable via 67% governance
5. **Gas Budget** (Phase 2): No limit on product owners
6. **URL Claiming** (Phase 2): Both oracle-minted AND self-claim
7. **Reputation Flow** (Phase 2): Smart default (auto-split) with override

   - ✅ NES-inspired accent colors (Success, Error, Warning, Info)
   - ✅ CRT screen effect backgrounds
   - ✅ Monospace font system (retro terminal feel)

2. **MainScreen.kt** (285 lines) - Navigation and main UI framework
   - ✅ Animated color-cycling title screen
   - ✅ NES-style status bar with blinking network indicator
   - ✅ CRT-bordered content area
   - ✅ Screen navigation system (6 screens)
   - ✅ Bottom info bar with version display

3. **Screens.kt** (400 lines) - Complete screen implementations
   - ✅ Identity Status Screen (tier display, stats panel)
   - ✅ Claim Verification Screen (request primary ID, link accounts)
   - ✅ Vouch System Screen (view claims, rewards)
   - ✅ Oracle Panel Screen (trusted oracle interface)
   - ✅ Settings Screen (network connection, contract addresses, god mode)
   - ✅ Shared components (headers, info boxes, buttons)

**Build Configuration:**
- ✅ `build.gradle.kts` - Kotlin Compose Desktop setup
- ✅ `gradle.properties` - Java 17 toolchain configuration
- ✅ Native distribution support (DMG, MSI, DEB)
- ✅ Proper icon configuration for all platforms

**Technical Challenges Resolved:**
1. **Gradle Version Compatibility**: Upgraded plugins to Kotlin 2.1.0 and Compose 1.7.3 for Gradle 9.1
2. **Package Version**: Fixed version format (0.1.0 → 1.0.0)
3. **Java Version Mismatch**: Configured Java 17 toolchain via gradle.properties
4. **Kotlin Daemon Issues**: Killed cached daemons using Java 25

**Total Lines of Code**: ~800 lines of Kotlin Compose UI code

**Running the App:**
```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/knomee-identity-8bit/desktop-client
./gradlew run
```

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Animated title with color-cycling effect
- ✅ Real-time network status indicator
- ✅ Identity tier visualization with NES colors
- ✅ Complete navigation between all screens
- ✅ Info boxes with protocol mechanics
- ✅ Retro button styling with NES borders

---

### Week 3: NPC Simulation + Testing
**Status**: Not started
**Target**: Behavior scripts, god mode controls, analytics

---

### Week 4: Polish + Documentation
**Status**: Not started
**Target**: 8-bit assets, sound effects, video demo

---

## Phase 2: Product & Reputation Layer (Weeks 5-8)

**Status**: Architecture designed, not yet implemented

Contracts to build:
- ProductRegistry.sol (fractional ownership, unlimited owners, mutable governance)
- ReputationDistribution.sol (auto-split + directed flow)

---

## Technical Debt / Notes

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Restore README.md** - Foundry overwrote our custom README with template
2. **Remove Foundry Counter.sol** - Template contract not needed
3. **Update foundry.toml** - Ensure remappings point to correct paths

### Design Clarifications Made
- **Linked IDs**: String-based platform names (not enum) for future-proofing
- **Multiple accounts**: Allowed with justification field in claims
- **Justification**: All claims include `string justification` explaining the request
- **God mode**: Temporary testing feature, must be renounced before mainnet

### Key Implementation Details
```solidity
// Flexible linked ID mapping (not enum)
mapping(address => mapping(string => address)) public linkedIds;

// Examples:
linkedIds[primary]["LinkedIn"] = 0xabc
linkedIds[primary]["LinkedIn-business"] = 0xdef
linkedIds[primary]["TikTok"] = 0x123  // Future platform

// Justification examples:
"This is my business LinkedIn account"
"I am a unique human living in California"
"These addresses show identical on-chain behavior"
```
